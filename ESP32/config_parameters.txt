Parameters (modifiable settings)
IMU firmware (IMU_RECIEVER.ino)

Network / cloud
- `PATIENT_ID` (default `"p1"`)  
  Patient identifier embedded in each JSON payload so the backend updates the correct Firestore paths.
- `WIFI_SSID`, `WIFI_PASSWORD`  
  Wi-Fi credentials used by `WiFi.begin()` to connect the IMU ESP32 to the network.
- `CLOUD_URL`  
  The IMU posts JSON to this URL using Arduino `HTTPClient`.

ESP-NOW
- `RADAR_MAC[6]`  
  Destination ESP32 MAC address for ESP-NOW packets (the radar board).
- `ESPNOW_SEND_MS`   
  Interval between ESP-NOW status transmissions. 

Step / stair detection
- `threshold`  
  Step detection sensitivity: required gap between current acceleration magnitude (`amag`) and its moving-average baseline.  
- `bufferLength`  
  Window size for moving-average baseline.
- `debounceDelay` 
  Minimum time between step detections to prevent double counting after a step.
- `yThreshold` 
  Minimum absolute delta on the Y axis per sample used to stop noise from triggering steps.

Stair window + classification
- `STAIR_WIN_MS` 
  Accumulation window after a candidate step. 
- `STAIRS_ALIM_RMS_TH`  
  Minimum linear acceleration magnitude during stair window.
- `STAIRS_TILT_RANGE_TH`  
  Minimum tilt angle range during stair window. 
  
Fall detection
The fall logic is typically a combination of impact + rotation + stillness over time.

- `IMPACT_G`  
  Impact threshold (g units). 
- `ROT_DPS`  
  Rotation threshold (deg/sec). Used to require fast rotation.
- `TILT_DEG`  
  Tilt threshold (degrees) after suspected fall. Used to confirm unusual orientation.
- `STILL_W`  
  Gyro stillness threshold. Must be below this to consider “not moving.”
- `STILL_AL`  
  Linear acceleration stillness threshold. Must be below this to consider “settled.”

Timing parameters (ms):
- `STILL_TIME_MS`  
  Duration stillness must persist to confirm a fall.
- `SUSPECT_TIMEOUT_MS`  
  Maximum time allowed in SUSPECT before aborting back to NORMAL if confirmation conditions aren’t met.

Radar firmware (Radar-sender.ino)

Network / cloud
- `PATIENT_ID`, `WIFI_SSID`, `WIFI_PASSWORD`, `CLOUD_URL`  
  Same roles as IMU: identify patient, connect to Wi-Fi, post telemetry/alerts to backend.
- `WIFI_RETRY_MS` 
  Minimum interval between reconnect attempts. Prevents tight reconnect loops and reduces power usage.

Radar hardware
- `RX_PIN` (default 26), `TX_PIN` (default 27)  
  UART pins connected to the RD-03D radar module.

IMU freshness / fusion logic
- `IMU_FRESH_MS`  
  Maximum age for last received IMU ESP-NOW packet. If exceeded, IMU state is treated as stale and radar relies more on its own motion cues.

Tracking tuning
These parameters control how aggressively you “stick” to one target vs switching.

- `GATE_DPOS_M`  
  Position gating in meters: maximum allowed jump from last track position for a candidate to be considered the same target.
- `GATE_DV`  
  Velocity gating: maximum allowed velocity difference to accept a candidate as the same target.
- `V_MOVE_TH`  
  Velocity magnitude threshold to mark radar target as moving.
- `FAST_V`  
  High-speed cutoff: penalizes targets moving too fast to be the intended patient target.
- `NEED_STABLE_TO_LOCK`  
  Number of consecutive frames required to declare a stable lock on a target.
- `MAX_LOST_FRAMES`  
  How many frames you can lose the target before dropping lock and restarting search.
- `MIN_Y_M`, `MAX_Y_M`  
  Valid distance band (meters). Rejects too near/too far detections.

Immobility alert
- `IMMOBILITY_TIMEOUT` 
  Time without movement before sending a long immobility alert. 
- Alert JSON type: `"long_immobility"`  
  Event type string sent to backend.
